# Stock Market Predictions with Machine Learning

### Introduction
This repository contains a machine learning project focused on predicting stock market prices. The core of this project is a Jupyter Notebook (stock_market_analysis.ipynb) that demonstrates the data collection, preprocessing, model training, and prediction phases using Python and various machine learning libraries.

Our goal is to provide an accessible introduction to the techniques and methodologies involved in applying machine learning to financial markets. This project is designed for educational purposes and should not be used as financial advice.

### Features
**Data Collection:** How to gather stock price data from various sources.
**Data Preprocessing:** Preparing the data for modeling, including cleaning and normalization.
**Model Training:** A guide through different machine learning models tested in this project.
**Prediction:** Demonstrating the prediction process and evaluating the model's performance.

### Prerequisites
Before you can run the notebook, you'll need to install several Python packages. This project was developed using Python 3.x. Ensure you have it installed on your system. The primary libraries used include:
* numpy
* pandas
* scikit-learn
* matplotlib

### Contributing
We welcome contributions to improve the accuracy of our predictions or extend the functionality of our analysis. If you'd like to contribute, please fork the repository and use a feature branch. Pull requests are warmly welcome.


### Disclaimer
This project is for educational purposes only. Stock market trading involves significant risk, and the predictions generated by this project should not be used as the sole basis for any investment decisions.
